    # A reading is a peice of data collected during a 
    # route (e.g. images, gps readings, etc) or an 
    # inference made based on those readings, e.g. 
    # interplated location based on gps points or
    # defect location based on images.
    #
    # Generally these will be returned in large lists and 
    # users will filter out readings that theya re not
    # interested in.
